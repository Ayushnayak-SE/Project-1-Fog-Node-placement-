# Project-1-Fog-Node-placement-
This study explores how the number of fog nodes affects network delay in IoT systems, aiming to improve performance We examine two IoT scenarios: a smart agriculture network with 100 IoT devices and a smart city network with 10,000 IoT devices We test three cases where the number of fog nodes increases from 1 to 15, 1 to 20, and 1 to 30.
